# ATM
This program simulates a simple ATM system where users can check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. It includes input validation for safe transactions and ensures the user cannot withdraw more than their current balance. The program is implemented using functions for each operation, ensuring a modular and clean structure.
 It allows a user to:

- ✅ Check Balance  
- ➕ Deposit Money  
- ➖ Withdraw Money  

The interface is **menu-driven**, and the program uses **functions for modularity** and **validations** to handle invalid input and edge cases.
